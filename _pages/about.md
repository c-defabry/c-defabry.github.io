This website is currently under developement

I grew up on the Nevada side of Tahoe (Yes, Tahoe is in Nevada too) in the city of Reno, where I attended The University of Nevada, Reno and earned my bachelors degree in geophysics. After working in industry for two years I returned to school and earned my Masters degree in geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin with Dr. Mrinal Sen as my advisor. I then began working on my PhD in hydrogeology at UT Austin with Dr. M. Bayani Cardenas and Dr. J. Ann Chen. I am working on quantifying subsidence in fluvio-deltaic basins and relating subsidence to fluctuations in groundwater and aquifer deformation.

I am interested in observing and modeling groundwater flow both with traditional techniques as well as through the implementation of remote sensing techniques. I am currently attempting to understand what the principal controls on deformation are within a highly populated fluvio-deltaic region. In order to do this I am first defining the timescales of subsidence within my study area of Dhaka, Bangladesh by constructing Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images with a various temporal baselines. This has been recently completed allowing me to examine the effects of fluctutations in hydraulic head on the observed subsidence. Head records from surrounding aquifers are being correlated with the InSAR observed surface deformation in an attempt to better understand the aquifer skeletal properties. Once this correlation is established I will model groundwater pumping and produce synthetic head records that can be used to predict further subsidence. Finally the affects of inundation will be examined as I model both groundwater recharge and withdrawal so as to create the most realistic models possible. All of these efforts are being done due to the documented relationship arsenic has with groundwater withdrawal. In South Asia as well as the Western United States, arsenic concentrations in groundwater increase as groundpumping increases. This is due to the dewatering of aquitards into aquifers, following overpumping. The mixture of waters can create a chemical environment that can cause the arsenic to desorb from sediment grains and then travel as aqueous arsenic throughout the previously clean aquifer. I hope to minimize this phenomena by modeling various pumping scenarios that demonstrate how aquifers deform in response to groundwater withdrawal. This work is being done in the hopes that the groundwater resources that millions depend on can be considered safe for generations to come.
